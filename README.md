# WPA-plugin
WPA-plugin is a plugin built for WPA that parses `json` output of `wperf` to visualize counting and telemetry events as timeline graphs.

## WPA
###  What is WPA
Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA) is a tool that creates graphs and data tables of Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) events
that are recorded by Windows Performance Recorder (WPR), Xperf, or an assessment that is run in the
Assessment Platform. WPA can open any event trace log (ETL) file for analysis.

### Installation
WPA is included in the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK) that can be downloaded [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2243390).

> The wperf WPA plugin requires a WPA version of `11.0.7.2` or higher.

Once downloaded, make sure that "Windows Performance Toolkit" checkbox is checked under "Select the features you want to install".
